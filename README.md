# Stateful Todo App using DOM

A simple stateful Todo application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the use of the Document Object Model (DOM) to create, update, and manage a list of tasks in a dynamic and interactive way.

## Demo

- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed, visually differentiating them from incomplete tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent State**: The state of the todo list (tasks added, completed, or deleted) persists during the session.

## Technologies Used
